Hi there! Thanks for checking out my blog.

## My Background

I grew up near Seattle, Washington and went to school at [Brigham Young University](http://www.byu.edu) studying Information Systems.  Now I live in Salt Lake Utah with my wife and daughter.

I spent two years living in Japan serving as a missionary for the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](http://www.mormon.org).  I lived and worked in Shikoku, Wakayama, Okayama, Osaka, and Kobe.  I love the people and culture of Japan!

I am passionate about technology and love building web and mobile applications.  I am experienced with both front and back end development.  Some technologies I work with include React.js, React Native, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, PostgreSQL, and RethinkDB.

## This Blog

I hope that this blog can become a useful reference for both myself and others who are looking to learn and improve themselves!  I write about lots of subjects, usually related to programming.
